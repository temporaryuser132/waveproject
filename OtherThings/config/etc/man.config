#
# This file is read by man to configure the default manpath (also used
# when MANPATH contains an empty substring), to find out where the cat
# pages corresponding to given man pages should be stored,
# and to map each PATH element to a manpath element.
# It may also record the pathname of the man binary. [This is unused.]
# The format is:
#
# MANBIN		pathname
# MANPATH		manpath_element	[corresponding_catdir]
# MANPATH_MAP		path_element	manpath_element
#
# If no catdir is given, it is assumed to be equal to the mandir
# (so that this dir has both man1 etc. and cat1 etc. subdirs).
# Certain versions of the FSSTND recommend putting formatted versions
# of /usr/foopath/man/manx/page.x into /var/catman/foopath/catx/page.x.
# The keyword FSSTND will enable this peculiar behaviour.
# Explicitly given catdirs override.
